// This module imports the MongooseModule with the Musician schema, registers the MusiciansController and MusiciansService, and exports the MusiciansService for use in other modules.
// It allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of musician records in the database.
// The MusiciansService provides methods to interact with the Musician model, while the MusiciansController handles incoming requests related to musicians.
